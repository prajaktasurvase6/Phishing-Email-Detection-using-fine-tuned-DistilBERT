# Phishing Email Detection using DistilBERT

This project focuses on detecting phishing emails using a fine-tuned DistilBERT model. It classifies emails into two categories: ham (legitimate) and phishing (malicious) based on the email content.
We used DistilBERT for its efficiency and strong performance on text classification tasks, fine-tuned specifically for cybersecurity email detection.

## Results

- **Test Accuracy**: 97.67%
- **Phishing Detection Precision**: 99%
- **Ham Detection Recall**: 100%
- **Weighted F1-Score**: 98%

The model shows high precision and recall, making it effective at detecting phishing emails with minimal false positives.

## Summary

This project demonstrates the application of NLP models in cybersecurity for phishing detection. The DistilBERT model achieved excellent performance, providing a fast and lightweight solution to classify emails accurately and protect users from malicious attacks.
